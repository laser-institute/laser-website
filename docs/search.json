    "text": "Although social network analysis (SNA) and its educational antecedents date back to the early 1900s, the popularity of social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook have raised awareness of, and renewed interests in, social networks and their influence. As the use of digital resources continues to expand in education, data collected by these educational technologies has also greatly facilitated the application of network analysis to teaching and learning. The SNA modules are designed to prepare STEM education researchers to apply network analysis in order to better understand and improve student learning and the contexts in which learning occurs. The presentations, readings, and case studies for each module draw from the excellent book, Social Network Analysis and Education (Carolan 2014). Collectively, the modules provide education researchers with an overview of social network theory, examples of network analysis in STEM educational contexts, and applied experience with widely adopted tools and techniques.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "LASER BEAM participants will begin their program with an intensive 5-day summer training program at the FI, taught by NC State and Penn faculty and with invited presentations from Advisory Board members. Each Summer Institute will take place in July with pre-workshop preparation (e.g., introductions and needs assessment) for participants beginning earlier that spring. To attend to the needs of STEM education faculty and researchers with varying degrees of expertise in LA, the Summer Institute will provide both a beginner track and an advanced track to support faculty development, with approximately half of the participants in each track. The proposed Summer Institute schedule outlined in Table 2 provides an overview of the sequence of activities currently planned, recognizing that some adjustments will be necessary based on the needs assessment and specific modules participants are interested in teaching and/or learning from. Each of these activities is described in more detail below.\n\nSummer Institute Schedule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEST\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday\nThursday\nFriday\n\n\n9:00 - 9:30\nLASER Welcome\nCommunity Building\nCommunity Building\nCommunity Building\nCommunity Building\n\n\n9:40 - 11:00\nModule Overview\nModule Session 1\nModule Session 2\nModule Session 3\nModule Session 4\n\n\n11:15 - 12:30\nPedagogy Session\nModule Session 1 cont.\nModule Session 2 cont.\nModule Session 3 cont.\nModule Session 4 cont.\n\n\n1:30 - 2:45\nGuest Speaker\nGuest Speaker\nGuest Speaker\nGuest Speaker\nGuest Speaker\n\n\n3:00 - 3:45\nPedagogy Session\nPedagogy Session\nPedagogy Session\nPedagogy Session\nEvaluation\n\n\n4:00 - 5:00\nDesign Session\nDesign Session\nDesign Session\nDesign Session\nEarly Exit\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-Institute Preparation\nPrior to the Summer Institute, participants will complete a needs assessment to identify their teaching interests, experience with software packages, and skills and knowledge in relation to LA and advanced methods. This assessment will be used to identify the appropriate track for their Summer Institute experience and help guide the content, structure and sequence of their 5-day professional development. Instructors on the beginner track will also engage in pre-institute tutorials beginning in May and which must be completed prior to the workshop to demonstrate their preparation and commitment to LASER BEAM. Finally, all participants will engage in an initial community building activity designed to familiarize participants with the social platform that will be used throughout LASER BEAM as part of the Online Community and provide them with an opportunity to get to know each other prior to the Summer Institute.\n\n\nCommunity Building\nThe research and the project team’s experience leading faculty and educator training programs suggest community building activities are critical in supporting and affirming sustained participation in LA and data science initiatives, particularly for novice learners and scholars from minoritized groups (Arif et al., 2021). Consequently, LASER BEAM will incorporate identity-affirming activities each day of the workshop to help participants learn more about each other and create a sense of community (Booth & Kellogg, 2015; Deglau & O’Sullivan, 2006). By sharing their backgrounds, interests, and experiences, participants will identify commonalities and differences. This will create a space for participants to learn from each other and build on each other’s strengths.\n\n\nPedagogy Sessions\nParticipants in both the beginnerand advancedtracks will engage in whole group sessions to support them in adapting materials for their own instructional programs. Sessions will focus on a range of topics, from understanding the design principles behind the LASER BEAM curriculum to setting up the infrastructure necessary for learners to fully participate in module activities. Pedagogy sessions throughout the week will focus on the nuts and bolts of teaching the curriculum, including topics such as tools and approaches for facilitating in-person and online discussion, assessment and grading of assignments, and logistics for instructional delivery. For example, on Day 1 (Monday) participants are introduced to Posit Cloud, a powerful set of data science and instructional tools that can be accessed through an internet browser and used for assigning, supporting, and assessing instructional activities such as the interactive coding case studies and tutorials highlighted in Section 2c.\n\n\nModule Sessions\nModule sessions will be conducted in small groups and differentiated for participants in the beginnerand the advanced track based upon the needs assessment administered prior to the Summer Institute. These sessions will focus on the instructional materials from which participants will both learn from and use to train learners at their home institutions. Participants in the beginner track will focus on 4 introductory modules to develop their foundational knowledge and skills (see Section 2c) necessary for more advanced methods. Advanced track participants will engage in 4 module sessions focused on more advanced topics such as text classification and deep knowledge tracing. Sessions will be facilitated by members of the project team, who will model instructional best practices for use of these materials and participants in both tracks will work through select module activities just as would be expected from the students and faculty they plan to teach. Additionally, module sessions will be offered in an online format through workshops in the fall and spring (see Online Community section). This will allow the project team to both address topics not covered during the summer institute and to model instructional delivery in a purely online context.\n\n\nDesign Sessions\nEach day will end with small group activities to assist participants in designing a customized instructional plan at their home institutions, where they consider how to incorporate curriculum resources into their own contexts. The project team will collaborate with participants to choose relevant modules and activities, effective teaching methods (pedagogy), and suitable technology from our training resources that meet the needs of their learners. The team will also work with participants in aligning the chosen LA topics, pedagogy, and technology with the learners’ needs to ensure the modules are tailored to address the unique needs and preferences of their learners.\n\n\nGuest Speakers\nThese sessions will draw upon the backgrounds and expertise of our Advisory Board members and other invited guests who have taught courses, workshops, and training events focused on LA and related methods. Sessions will reinforce topics introduced in our module and pedagogy sessions, and help participants envision how LASER BEAM curriculum materials and activities might be adapted to fit their own contexts and institutional programs.",

The project team provides a range of activities designed to support participants and inform curriculum refinement throughout the year. These following are guided by findings from our prior research found to be strongly associated with successful online communities: \n\nMonthly Check-Ins\nThroughout fall and spring, the project team will facilitate formal monthly check-ins with participants on progress made towards implementing instructional plans developed duringthe Summer Workshop. The check-ins will also be used to gather feedback on curricular modules used by instructors. Guest speakers from our advisory board and other invited guests will also lead sessions on LA topics during check-ins. These sessions will be informed by the community, as well as more specialized topics in advanced methods.\n\n\nVirtual Module Sessions\nThese session are offered several times each month so participants can learn about research methods they were unable to experience during the Summer Institute, as well to model instructional use of the modules in a fully online context. The workshops are led by members of the project team as well as by past LASER Scholars.\n\n\nAsynchronous Activities\nFacilitated discussion channels and informal Q&As are hosted on our Slack workspace, which includes both current and past participants from prior LASER Institute cohorts. Discussions focus on shared problems of practice such as adapting instructional modules to local contexts or working with students who have limited programming experience, as well as topics related to module content such as R packages, conceptual overviews, and essential readings. \n\n\nResource Repositories\nA key deliverable of this grant is a freely available website that houses all the curriculum materials needed to teach, and learn from, the LASER curriculum. These materials consist of both project team and member-generated content hosted on GitHub and a new curriculum website currently under development. These website include materials for each module as well as supporting materials for instructors such as pedagogical tips, information on computing infrastructure, technology stack, and logistics for set up.",

This session aims to equip learners with the knowledge to apply these advanced research methods in their work, fostering innovation in STEM education.\n\n\nCode-Alongs\nThe second presentation provides a short but highly structured coding (see example) activity that demonstrates key packages and functions required for specific data analysis techniques highlighted in each unit and an exemplary research study. Both presentations include prompts for discussion to check participant understanding and connect content with their personal and professional research interests. Recorded versions of these presentations, as well as select presentations from Baker’s BDEMOOC, will also be provided on the LASER BEAM website to support independent learners. \n\n\n\nInstructional Deep Dives\n\nReadings & Reflection\nEssential Readings (see example) are curated for participants to help them dive deeper into LA concepts, techniques, and applications introduced in presentation and case studies. Each module also includes an exemplary research paper that illustrates how techniques highlighted in each module have been applied in STEM education contexts. These papers are often used to guide coding case studies and help connect technical skills required for advanced methods with authentic research applications. Accompanying these readings are guiding questions that can be used for personal reflection or to help instructors facilitate discussion and assess their understanding of module content.\n\n\nCoding Case Studies\nCase Study assignments (see example) developed by the project team are interactive coding experiences that can be completed by learners independently or in small groups. These activities demonstrate how key data-intensive research workflow processes (i.e., wrangling, visualizing, summarizing, modeling, and communicating data) featured in exemplary STEM education research studies are implemented in R or Python. Coding case studies also provide a holistic setting to explore important foundational LA topics integral to data analysis such as reproducible research, use of APIs, student privacy, ethical consideration, and diversity and inclusion in STEM education.\n\n\nOnline Tutorials\nOpenly accessible online tutorials are curated for each module and are intended to help learners develop technical proficiency with essential software packages, functions, and programming syntax introduced during conceptual overviews, code-alongs, and case studies. Tutorials include, but are not limited to, interactive R primers, recipes, and cheatsheets available on Posit Cloud, as well as Python and intelligent-tutor based assignments that scaffold students in learning to use learning analytics methods.\n\n\n\nAssessment\n\nBadges\nEach module includes a summative assessment activity designed to help learners reflect on how the concepts and techniques introduced in each lab might apply to their own STEM education research, where they can demonstrate their technical proficiency with the analytical techniques and methods addressed in each unit. Instructors are provided with digital Badges (see example) to award students upon successful completion of assessments. At the instructor’s discretion, badges can be sequenced into microcredentials that can be used to certify learners’ successful demonstration and/or application of LA methods.\n\n\nMicrocredentials\nMicrocredentials are designed for individuals seeking to validate their expertise in learning analytics are are offered for each research methods.To earn a microcredential, participants are required to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding and showcase their ability to effectively utilize learning analytics to gather, analyze, and communciate educational data to support their own research.",

    "text": "Activities for each instructional module are informed by lessons learned through PI Kellogg’s LASER Institute and LA Graduate Certificate program, and PI Baker’s experience offering BDEMOOC and other courses for over a decade. Modules will consist of carefully scaffolded activities designed to prepare participants for collaborative, data-intensive research, and to lower the barriers faced by scholars with little programming experience or research backgrounds in advanced methods. These activities will provide opportunities for participants to explore key topics in-depth and gain hands-on experience using analytic tools like R and Python to carry out essential data science workflow processes, including advanced methods for machine learning and text mining. In each module, participants will also explore how these methods have been applied by researchers in STEM education contexts and work with corresponding real-world datasets from a wide range of sources such as MOOCs, student information systems, and log data from digital learning platforms.\n\nInteractive Presentations\n\nEach module contain slide decks for two interactive presentations that provide an overview of key concepts, software packages and functions for data analysis. The first presentation focuses on a conceptual overview of key terminology, techniques, and applications. The second presentation provides a short but highly structured code-along activity that demonstrates key packages and functions required for specific data analysis techniques highlighted in each unit and an exemplary research study. Both presentations include prompts for discussion to check participant understanding and connect content with their personal and professional research interests. Recorded versions of these presentations, as well as select presentations from Baker’s BDEMOOC, will also be provided on the LASER BEAM website to support independent learners. \n\n\nCoding Case Studies\nCase study assignments developed by the project team are interactive coding experiences that can be completed by learners independently or in small groups.

Coding case studies also provide a holistic setting to explore important foundational LA topics integral to data analysis such as reproducible research, use of APIs, student privacy, ethical consideration, and diversity and inclusion in STEM education.\n\n\nReadings and Discussion\nEssential readings are curated for participants to help them dive deeper into LA concepts, techniques, and applications introduced in presentation and case studies. Each module includes an exemplary research article that illustrates how LA applications and/or techniques highlighted in each module (e.g., data visualization, topic modeling) have been used in STEM education contexts. These articles are also used to guide coding case studies and help connect technical skills required for advanced methods with authentic research applications. Instructors will be provided guiding questions to help them facilitate discussion among learners and assess their understanding of module content.\n\n\nSoftware Tutorials\nOpenly accessible software tutorials are curated for each module and are intended to help learners develop technical proficiency with essential software packages, functions, and programming syntax introduced during conceptual overviews, code-alongs, and case studies. Tutorials include, but are not limited to, interactive R primers available on Posit Cloud (CITATION) and Python and intelligent-tutor based assignments developed by UPenn that scaffold students in learning to use learning analytics methods (Aleven et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2021). \n\n\nBadges & Microcredentials\nEach module includes a summative assessment activity designed to help learners reflect on how the concepts and techniques introduced in each lab might apply to their own STEM education research, where they can demonstrate their technical proficiency with the analytical techniques and methods addressed in each unit. Instructors are provided with digital badges to award students upon successful completion of assessments. At the instructor’s discretion, badges can be sequenced into microcredentials that can be used to certify learners’ successful demonstration and/or application of LA methods. Microcredential certificates will also be created for learners who have demonstrated their ability to consider the potential applications and challenges of learning analytics in society. Badging activities and corresponding badges developed for the LASER Institute will be expanded to include new modules created from UPenn materials."
