title: "Modular by Design"
---

The LASER Institute curriculum is modular by design and consists of instructional modules that can be assembled into multiple distinct semester-long courses, incorporated into existing courses, or used individually for workshops, webinars, or other learning experiences. This design enables instructors to tailor content and activites for learners with different disciplinary backgrounds and to incorporate them as needed into new or existing programs, thereby expanding high-quality educational opportunities in LA for institutions that lack the resources to create these materials from scratch.

## Design Principles

The guiding design principle of the LASER BEAM curriculum, setting it apart from existing programs in learning analytics and educational data science, is a close connection between exemplary STEM education research and hands-on experience analyzing real-world datasets. This connection is essential for building the competencies necessary to carry out high-quality education research in STEM fields and to enable researchers to integrate methodological strategies and practices with theoretical and practical issues in STEM education. Guiding design principles the LASER curriculum include:

-   **Research Connections**. A close connection between exemplary STEM education research and hands-on experience analyzing real-world datasets.

-   **Scaffolded Activities**. Activities are carefully scaffolded to ease learners into the conceptual and technical aspects of learning analytics and to gradually release instructor supports.

-   **Hands-On Programming**. Experience using modern, industry standard analytic tools like R and Python to carry out essential data science workflow processes.

-   **Real-World Data**. real-world datasets from a wide range of sources such as MOOCs, student information systems, and log data from digital learning platforms.

-   **Topic Deep Dives**. Each Module Opportunities for participants to explore key topics in-depth through Essential Readings and coding Case Studies.

-   **Lowered Barriers**. Activities are designed to lower the barriers faced by researchers with little programming experience or research backgrounds in advanced methods.

## Modules Topics

LASER modules cover a broad range of both introductory and advanced methods frequently leveraged by LA researchers and explicitly illustrate how these methods have been applied in STEM education research. Introductory modules will focus on basic concepts pertaining to each research method and proficiency with software tools commonly employed in LA and data science more broadly (i.e., R, Python, GitHub, APIs) and focus on topics pertaining to data-intensive research workflows (Krumm et al., 2018). Modules addressing advanced methods focus on a range of exploratory and modeling techniques including supervised machine learning, unsupervised learning, relationship mining, topic modeling and LLMs, knowledge tracing and knowledge graphs, and social and epistemic network analysis.

Interwoven within and across modules, and as appropriate to each method, are topics designed to deepen learners' understanding of LA approaches, applications, and legal and ethical issues. Specifically, topics will include but are not limited to reproducible research and open-science standards; types of data used in LA and the methods for their collection; applications of LA to STEM educational contexts such as recommendation and intelligent tutoring systems, adaptive learning and curriculum design, and students at risk of failing a course; and legal and ethical considerations such as student privacy, data ethics and algorithmic bias. In addition, learners are introduced to frameworks and approaches such as research-practice partnerships to prepare them to work closely with educational organizations to improve STEM outcomes at the local, district and state level.

## Module Activities

Each instructional module consist of carefully scaffolded activities designed to prepare participants for collaborative, data-intensive research, and to lower the barriers faced by scholars with little programming experience or research backgrounds in advanced methods. These activities provide opportunities for participants to explore key topics in-depth and gain hands-on experience using analytic tools like R and Python to carry out essential data science workflow processes, including advanced methods for machine learning and text mining. In each module, participants will also explore how these methods have been applied by researchers in STEM education contexts and work with corresponding real-world datasets from a wide range of sources such as MOOCs, student information systems, and log data from digital learning platforms.

### Introductory Presentations

#### Conceptual Overviews

Each module includes a presentation([see example](https://laser-institute.github.io/network-analysis/lab-1/sna-1-conceptual-overview.html#/title-slide)) that introduces of key concepts, terminology, and applications as they relate to each corresponding research methods and their associated techniques. Conceptual Overviews are facilitated by instructors and include opportunites for discussions, questions, and practical activities, enabling participants to demonstrate their grasp of the material. This session aims to equip learners with the knowledge to apply these advanced research methods in their work, fostering innovation in STEM education.
