The Learning Analytics in STEM Education Research (LASER) Institute is a year-long professional development program for early and mid-career scholars funded by the National Science Foundation. The LASER Institute aims to increase the number of early and mid-career scholars capable of leveraging new data sources and applying computational research methods to support their existing research.

This website contains all the materials needed to teach with, and learn from, the LASER Institute's instructional materials. The website is organized into three sections:

-   **Institute**. The Institute section provides an overview of the program, including the LASER Insitute's goals and objectives, in-person summer workshop and online learning components, and the design of curriculum modules and instruction activities.

-   **Curriculum**. The curriculum section includes everything you need learn with LASER and is organized by research methods taught by the project team. Each method area consists of four instructional modules consisting of slide decks, essential readings, discussion questions, code-alongs, case studies, and assessment activities.

-   **Instruction**. The instruction section includes everything instructors need to teach with LASER. This section includes information and resources on pedagogical design, computing infrastructure, sample teaching formats, and logistics for using LASER curriculum materials for a webinar, workshop, or course.
